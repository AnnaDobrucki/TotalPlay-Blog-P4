# TotalPlay

Total Play is my own personal love letter(s) for TTRPG's (Table top role playing games), in recent years there has been a resurgence of D&D/Pathfinder/Warhammer40k and these have brought in a whole new generation of gaming. With so many new start upsout there, and older classic games coming out with new stuff, it's hard to keep up and know what might be best to play for yourself.

This blog intertwines reading about whats out there but also allows people to book 1:1 sessions with myself, to chat about any TTRPG's.
